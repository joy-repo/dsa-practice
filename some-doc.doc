I am pleased to share that I have joined the ICB team as Vice President. With over 11 years of experience in software development across diverse domains, my primary focus will be on leading new feature development and enhancing system resilience.

I hail from Kolkataâ€”fondly known as the City of Joy and the birthplace of the beloved rosogolla.

I look forward to contributing meaningfully to our collective mission and collaborating to create enduring value.
